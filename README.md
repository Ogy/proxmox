# Proxmox

You need to manage a proxmox host with Ruby? This library is for you.

Inspirated from:
https://bitbucket.org/jmoratilla/knife-proxmox/ but I would like to have
the same without chef.
https://github.com/maxschulze/uv_proxmox but listing some task does not
work for me. No tests, use ssh.

So I start to create one fully tested (TDD method).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'proxmox'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install proxmox

## Usage

At this time check specs to have code samples.
